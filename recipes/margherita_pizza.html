        Description
    </h3>
   <p>What’s the origin of this popular pizza topping? Invented in the 1800s, pizza margherita showcases the colors of the Italian flag: red from the tomato sauce, white from the mozzarella, and green from the basil. It’s believed that the margherita is named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, an Italian queen in the 1800’s.</p> 

    <p>How to pronounce margherita pizza? It sounds like the classic Mexican cocktail, the margarita, which incidentally is a common misspelling of this word! With an proper Italian accent, it sounds like pit-za mar-geh-REE-ta.</p> 


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>1 batch easy whole wheat pizza dough or 1 pound store-bought pizza dough</li>
       <li>1 large can (28 ounces) whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 ounces (dry weight) ovoline-type mozzarella or other fresh mozzarella balls, ideally water-packed</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh basil, thinly sliced plus small leaves</li>
        <li> Additional garnishes: Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, flaky sea salt or kosher salt and optional red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.</li>
        <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</li>
        <li>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you’re working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
        <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
        <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. Leftover pizza will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
    </ol>
